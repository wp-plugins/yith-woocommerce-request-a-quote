The YITH Woocommerce Request A Quote plugin lets your customers ask for an estimate of a list of products they are interested into.

== Description ==

= Give real information for real persuasion =
YITH Woocommerce Request A Quote lets your customers ask for an estimate for a list of WooCommerce products they are interested in.

With just a single button in detail page of the concerned WooCommerce product, users can create their own list and receive an estimate from the administrators.

Quotations are one of the best ways to deal with certain types of purchases and it is very difficult to be played for online purchases.

One of the biggest limits of online business, in fact, is the impossibility to negotiate, to do that compromise that should be agreed by both buyer and supplier. And it is comprehensible that, say, for a big amount of products, supplier and buyer might meet phisically, talk together and find a reasonable solution that suits both of them.
All this becomes possible also for online shops thanks to this WooCommerce plugin. YITH Woocommerce Request A Quote allows contact between suppliers and customers and sharing of the list of items for which the quote is requested.
Customers can ask for an estimate and admin can answer them back with a quotation proposal. Customers can either accept or reject the offer for the WooCommerce products they have added to the quote.
Negotiation becomes possible and this can definitely increase purchases in your WooCommerce shop.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I hide Add to cart button in single page product? =
Yes, in Yit Plugins > Request A Quote > Settings page, you can choose hide or show "Add to cart" button.

= Is it compatible with all WordPress themes? =

Compatibility with all themes is impossible, because they are too many, but generally if themes are developed according to WordPress and WooCommerce guidelines, YITH plugins are compatible with them.
Yet, we can grant compatibility with themes developed by YIThemes, because they are constantly updated and tested with our plugins. Sometimes, especially when new versions are released, it might only require some time for them to be all updated, but you can be sure that they will be tested and will be working in a few days. 

= How can I get support if my WooCommerce plugin is not working? =

If you have problems with our plugins or something is not working as it should, first follow this preliminary steps:

* Test the plugin with a WordPress default theme, to be sure that the error is not caused by the theme you are currently using.
* Deactivate all plugins you are using and check if the problem is still occurring.
* Ensure that you plugin version, your theme version and your WordPress and WooCommerce version (if required) are updated and that the problem you are experiencing has not already been solved in a later plugin update.

If none of the previous listed actions helps you solve the problem, then, submit a ticket in the forum and describe your problem accurately, specify WordPress and WooCommerce versions you are using and any other information that might help us solve your problem as quickly as possible. Thanks!
